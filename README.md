Welcome to my GitHub repository for storing online learning certificates. Here's how it works:

## How to Use

1. **Certificate PDFs**: Each certificate PDF is uploaded and committed using its certificate name as the commit message.
   
   For example, if you completed a course titled "The Complete Ubuntu Linux Server Administration Course 2023" and received a certificate named "UC-1c576ba6-602c-4494-b281-d7e7396d9cf2.pdf", you would upload the PDF and commit it with the message "Update UC-1c576ba6-602c-4494-b281-d7e7396d9cf2.pdf".

2. **Commit History**: You can track my learning progress and the certificates I've earned by viewing the commit history. Each commit corresponds to a completed course or program.

   For instance, if you're interested in the courses I completed last month, you can find them by filtering the commit history accordingly.

## Repository Structure
